# responsive_layout_v2
Project 2 of Team Treehouse Techdegree program. In this project you'll build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The design should respond to small, medium, and large viewport sizes and devices; and demonstrate an understanding of responsive design.  You will write basic layout styles to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using media queries, add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
